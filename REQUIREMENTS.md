# Technical Full Stack Prompt

**Background:** Solace wants to see how you develop code and deliver a small project that would be similar to your day-to-day work at Solace. The app built here will flex both your backend and frontend skill sets.

Solace has a feature that allows advocates to create notes on both their individual client appointments and contract work they perform for the client. A simple feature that has proven very valuable for advocates to solidify all their information inside one application that they can then share with their clients as they see fit. We want you to build the first iteration of what that feature was for Solace.

**Goal:** The deliverable out of this should be a link to a Github repo, whatever documentation you might think would be helpful and ideally a working web app hosted somewhere publicly accessible.

Please build a very simple “Notes” Web App. An app that will allow a user to Index, Create, Update and Delete notes.

Our main goal is to see how you put the pieces together, so feel free to be creative and have fun with it. Please ensure that you cover all of the acceptance criteria mentioned below but be sure to add your own spin on it and if you have to make tradeoffs in any area, that’s fine, just mention what and why in your documentation. Technical framework decisions are up to you (so long as they are in the JS/TS family), if you want this to be a NestJS and React app, great! If you want it to be a NextJS app, also great! If you want to do another framework or a hybrid, also great!

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Must be written with JavaScript or Typescript (preferred)
- Note Form must have the following validations
    - Must not be shorter then 20 characters
    - Must not be longer then 300 characters
- Main page must include all the notes and a way to create a new note
- Main page must include a search bar that will find based on a notes content. (Client or Server query is fine)
- Must include README with steps on how to run the application(s) locally.
